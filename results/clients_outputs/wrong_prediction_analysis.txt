ANALYSIS: WHY THE MODEL GOT THIS PREDICTION WRONG
======================================================================

True Outcome: DEFAULTED (1)
Model Predicted Probability of Default: 10.75%
Model Decision: LOW RISK

ERROR TYPE: FALSE NEGATIVE (Missed a defaulter)
This is a DANGEROUS error - the model approved a risky client.

FACTORS THAT MISLED THE MODEL (pushed toward 'safe'):
--------------------------------------------------
  • Basementarea Avg
    Client Value: 0.4389, Population Mean: 0.0884
    SHAP Impact: -1.3565 (pushed toward SAFE)
  • Goods Price
    Client Value: 1170000.0000, Population Mean: 538396.2074
    SHAP Impact: -0.9051 (pushed toward SAFE)
  • Elevators Medi
    Client Value: 0.7400, Population Mean: 0.0781
    SHAP Impact: -0.6992 (pushed toward SAFE)
  • Livingarea Medi
    Client Value: 0.7242, Population Mean: 0.1086
    SHAP Impact: -0.6102 (pushed toward SAFE)
  • Ext Source Mean
    Client Value: 0.6958, Population Mean: 0.5114
    SHAP Impact: -0.4696 (pushed toward SAFE)

CONCLUSION:
--------------------------------------------------
The model relies heavily on external scores (EXT_SOURCE) and employment
data. This client likely had atypical patterns that don't fit the linear
assumptions of logistic regression. A tree-based model might capture
such non-linear interactions better.
